# ECommerce web application with .NET and Angular

This is a proof-of-concept web application for an e-commerce site, the back-end is built in .NET, using the generic repository anti-pattern, complemented by the specification pattern (an auxiliar class to further specify and build a query so we don't get limited by using the generic repository, allowing us to eager load the related entities of a certain model, for example). The graphic client of the application is an Angular project, that consumes our .NET written APIs.
